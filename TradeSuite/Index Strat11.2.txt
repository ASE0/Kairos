System Overview
Market Environment Classification (Tick-Based)
Every 5000 ticks, calculate:
1. Order Flow Efficiency = |CVD[0] - CVD[5000]| / Sum(|Volume_i|)
2. Trade Size Distribution = Large_Trades / Total_Trades
3. Spread Volatility = StdDev(Bid_Ask_Spread) / Mean(Spread)

Market States:
- TRENDING: Order Flow Efficiency > 0.3 AND Large Trade Ratio > 0.4
- RANGING: Bid/Ask Balance within 45-55% AND Spread stable
- VOLATILE: Spread Volatility > 2.0 OR Sweep frequency > normal
- TOXIC: Spread > 2 ticks OR Quote changes > 100/second
News Time Handling
News Windows (ET):
- 8:30 AM ± 10 min: Major economic data
- 10:00 AM ± 10 min: Secondary data
- 2:00 PM ± 5 min: Fed minutes (when applicable)

During news windows:
- Increase minimum trade size filter by 2x
- Require 2x normal edge to enter
- Exit all positions 30 seconds before

Strategy 1: Order Flow Momentum (OFM)
Best for: Institutional accumulation/distribution phases
Parameters (5):
CVD_Period = 1000 ticks
Imbalance_Threshold = 1500 contracts (net delta)
Large_Trade_Size = 10 contracts minimum
Absorption_Ratio = 400 (volume per tick movement)
Trail_Ticks = 3
Entry Conditions:
python
# Calculate on every tick
cvd = cumulative_volume_delta(CVD_Period)
trade_sizes = [t.size for t in last_n_trades(CVD_Period)]
large_ratio = len([t for t in trade_sizes if t >= Large_Trade_Size]) / len(trade_sizes)
absorption = volume_last_100_ticks / price_range_ticks

# Microstructure signals
bid_pulling = bid_size_decreased > ask_size_decreased  # Bullish
ask_pulling = ask_size_decreased > bid_size_decreased  # Bearish

# LONG Entry (all conditions must be true):
1. cvd > Imbalance_Threshold
2. large_ratio > 0.35  # Institutional involvement
3. absorption < Absorption_Ratio  # Not hitting resistance
4. bid_pulling == True  # Market makers bullish
5. spread <= 1 tick

# SHORT Entry (opposite conditions)

# Execution: 
- Place limit at best_bid + 1 (aggressive post)
- If not filled in 100ms, market order
- Cancel if spread widens > 1 tick
Exit Conditions:
python
# Initial Stop:
Long: Largest bid cluster below entry - 1 tick
Short: Largest ask cluster above entry + 1 tick

# Dynamic Exit based on order flow:
if position == LONG:
    # Trail when flow continues
    if cvd_since_entry > 0:
        stop = max(stop, current_bid - Trail_Ticks)
    
    # Exit on flow reversal
    if cvd_last_200_ticks < -Imbalance_Threshold/3:
        exit_market()
    
    # Exit on absorption (resistance)
    if volume_at_price_level > Absorption_Ratio * 2:
        exit_limit(current_bid)
Position Sizing:
python
# Tick-based volatility
tick_changes_per_minute = count_tick_changes(60_seconds)
volatility_scalar = min(1.0, 20 / tick_changes_per_minute)

Risk_Per_Trade = Account_Value * 0.01 * volatility_scalar
Tick_Risk = abs(entry - stop) / tick_size
Contracts = floor(Risk_Per_Trade / (Tick_Risk * tick_value))

Strategy 2: Microstructure Mean Reversion (MMR)
Best for: Sweep exhaustion and liquidity gaps
Parameters (5):
Sweep_Threshold = 75 contracts (single aggressive order)
Book_Imbalance = 3.0 (bid/ask ratio)
Quiet_Period = 200 ticks
Reversion_Percent = 0.6
Max_Heat = 4 ticks
Setup Identification:
python
# Detect aggressive sweep
sweep = None
for trade in trades:
    if trade.size >= Sweep_Threshold and trade.aggressor:
        levels_taken = count_price_levels(trade)
        if levels_taken >= 3:  # Swept multiple levels
            sweep = {
                'price': trade.price,
                'direction': trade.side,
                'size': trade.size,
                'levels': levels_taken,
                'timestamp': trade.time
            }

# Monitor post-sweep activity
if sweep:
    quiet_ticks = 0
    total_volume = 0
    
    for tick in subsequent_ticks:
        quiet_ticks += 1
        total_volume += tick.volume
        
        if quiet_ticks >= Quiet_Period:
            avg_volume = total_volume / quiet_ticks
            if avg_volume < sweep.size * 0.2:  # Volume dried up
                setup_ready = True
Entry Conditions:
python
# Book analysis at each price level
def analyze_book_support():
    bid_support = sum([level.size for level in bid_book[:5]])
    ask_pressure = sum([level.size for level in ask_book[:5]])
    return bid_support / ask_pressure

# LONG Entry (fade down sweep):
if sweep.direction == 'SELL' and setup_ready:
    if analyze_book_support() > Book_Imbalance:
        # Strong bid support after sweep
        entry_price = sweep.price + 1_tick
        place_limit_order(LONG, entry_price)

# SHORT Entry (fade up sweep):
if sweep.direction == 'BUY' and setup_ready:
    if 1/analyze_book_support() > Book_Imbalance:
        # Strong ask resistance after sweep
        entry_price = sweep.price - 1_tick
        place_limit_order(SHORT, entry_price)

# Cancel if not filled within 50 ticks
Exit Logic:
python
# Fixed stops based on sweep range
Long: sweep.price - (sweep.levels * tick_size)
Short: sweep.price + (sweep.levels * tick_size)

# Target: Reversion percentage
Long: entry + (Reversion_Percent * (entry - sweep.price))
Short: entry - (Reversion_Percent * (sweep.price - entry))

# Time stop
if ticks_since_entry > 500 and pnl < 0:
    exit_market()

# Max heat protection
if adverse_excursion > Max_Heat:
    exit_market()

Strategy 3: Liquidity Vacuum Breakout (LVB)
Best for: Pre-breakout consolidation with dried up volume
Parameters (5):
Consolidation_Ticks = 500
Volume_Reduction = 0.3 (vs average)
Range_Ticks = 5 (max during consolidation)
Breakout_Volume = 100 contracts
Target_Multiple = 2.5
Consolidation Detection:
python
# Rolling window analysis
windows = []
for i in range(0, total_ticks, Consolidation_Ticks):
    window = ticks[i:i+Consolidation_Ticks]
    
    window_stats = {
        'high': max([t.price for t in window]),
        'low': min([t.price for t in window]),
        'volume': sum([t.volume for t in window]),
        'range': (high - low) / tick_size
    }
    
    # Check if consolidating
    if window_stats['range'] <= Range_Ticks:
        avg_volume_prior = mean([w.volume for w in windows[-10:]])
        if window_stats['volume'] < avg_volume_prior * Volume_Reduction:
            consolidation = {
                'high': window_stats['high'],
                'low': window_stats['low'],
                'mid': (high + low) / 2,
                'start_tick': i
            }
Entry Triggers:
python
# Monitor for breakout
if consolidation:
    for tick in subsequent_ticks:
        # Volume surge detection
        tick_cvd = tick.ask_volume - tick.bid_volume
        
        # LONG Breakout:
        if (tick.price > consolidation['high'] and 
            tick.volume >= Breakout_Volume and
            tick_cvd > 0):  # Buying pressure
            
            # Confirm with next tick
            if next_tick.price >= tick.price:
                enter_long_market()
                
        # SHORT Breakout:
        if (tick.price < consolidation['low'] and
            tick.volume >= Breakout_Volume and
            tick_cvd < 0):  # Selling pressure
            
            # Confirm with next tick
            if next_tick.price <= tick.price:
                enter_short_market()
Stop and Target:
python
# Stops: Other side of consolidation
Long: consolidation['low'] - 1_tick
Short: consolidation['high'] + 1_tick

# Targets: Multiple of risk
Long: entry + (Target_Multiple * (entry - stop))
Short: entry - (Target_Multiple * (stop - entry))

# Breakout failure protection
if ticks_since_entry > 100:
    if position == LONG and price < consolidation['high']:
        exit_market()  # Failed breakout
    if position == SHORT and price > consolidation['low']:
        exit_market()

Master Control Layer (Tick-Based)
Tick Data Quality Checks:
python
def validate_tick_data():
    # Check for data issues
    if bid > ask:
        return False  # Crossed market
    if spread > 5 * normal_spread:
        return False  # Wide spread
    if time_since_last_tick > 1000ms:
        return False  # Stale data
    if bid_size == 0 or ask_size == 0:
        return False  # No liquidity
    return True
Strategy Selection:
python
def select_strategy(market_state, tick_metrics):
    # Toxic market - no trading
    if market_state == "TOXIC" or not validate_tick_data():
        return None
    
    # Clear institutional flow
    if abs(cvd_5000) > 5000 and large_trade_ratio > 0.4:
        return "OFM"
    
    # Post-sweep opportunity
    if recent_sweep_detected and ticks_since_sweep > 100:
        return "MMR"
    
    # Consolidation breakout setup
    if volatility_contraction and volume_decline:
        return "LVB"
    
    return None  # No clear opportunity
Risk Management:
python
# Tick-based risk metrics
MAX_TICKS_PER_SECOND = 50  # Above this = news/unusual
MIN_BOOK_DEPTH = 100  # Contracts each side minimum
MAX_SPREAD = 2  # Ticks

# Pre-trade checks
if ticks_per_second > MAX_TICKS_PER_SECOND:
    disable_trading(60_seconds)

if book_depth < MIN_BOOK_DEPTH:
    reduce_size_by_half()

if spread > MAX_SPREAD:
    cancel_all_orders()
    flatten_positions()

Mathematical Validation Framework (Tick Data)
1. Microstructure Statistics:
python
# Tick-level metrics
- Fill_Rate = Filled_Orders / Total_Orders
- Adverse_Selection = mean(price_1000_ticks_later - fill_price)
- Implementation_Shortfall = (fill_price - decision_price) / decision_price

# Acceptance criteria:
Fill_Rate > 0.85
Adverse_Selection < 0.5 * average_profit
Implementation_Shortfall < 0.1 * tick_size
2. Execution Quality:
python
# Slippage analysis
Slippage_Distribution = histogram(fill_price - intended_price)
Expected_Slippage = mean(slippage)
Slippage_95th = percentile(slippage, 95)

# Queue position analysis
Queue_Position = (our_order_id - first_order_id) / total_orders
Time_To_Fill = timestamp_fill - timestamp_place

# Targets:
Expected_Slippage < 0.5 ticks
Queue_Position < 0.3  # Front of queue
median(Time_To_Fill) < 500ms
3. Market Impact:
python
# Temporary impact
Temp_Impact = (price_at_fill - price_at_decision) / order_size
# Permanent impact  
Perm_Impact = (price_10min_later - price_at_decision) / order_size

# Model: Impact = α√size + β*participation_rate
Run regression to find α, β

# Capacity constraint
Max_Order_Size = Daily_Volume * 0.001  # 0.1% participation
4. Information Ratio:
python
# Tick-based Sharpe
tick_returns = [exit_price/entry_price - 1 for each trade]
tick_sharpe = mean(tick_returns) / std(tick_returns) * sqrt(trades_per_year)

# Information coefficient
IC = correlation(predicted_move, actual_move)
Breadth = number_of_independent_bets

Information_Ratio = IC * sqrt(Breadth)
Target: IR > 0.5

Implementation Requirements
Technology Stack:
Data Feed: Direct exchange connections (not consolidated)
Processing: In-memory tick database (kdb+ or Arctic)
Execution: Native exchange protocols (FIX/OUCH)
Latency: Sub-100ms tick-to-trade
Minimum Data Requirements:
python
# Per tick:
- Timestamp (microsecond precision)
- Bid/Ask price and size
- Trade price, size, and aggressor flag
- Book depth (5 levels minimum)

# Calculated in real-time:
- CVD (cumulative volume delta)
- Trade size distribution  
- Book imbalance ratios
- Microstructure features
Critical Success Factors:
Data Quality: Direct feeds, no aggregation
Fast Execution: Limit orders with quick cancels
Risk First: Many "no trade" conditions
Small Edge: 0.1-0.3 ticks per trade after costs
High Frequency: 10-50 trades per day
Tight Stops: 3-5 ticks maximum
This tick-based architecture captures real order flow and microstructure inefficiencies that time-based bars completely miss.
